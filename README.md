# Project-DD2404

Simple program to take multialignments and reduce the noise.
Phylogenetic trees are then generated for both the original and the filtered alignments.
All the trees are compared to a reference tree using symmetric distance, the results written to the file `result`

Usage:

* Download the directory `original_msa`

* Run `run.sh`

* Run `compare.sh`

* Run `eval_result`

Results are written to the file `results` and to the images in the directory `histograms`
