# Reducing noise in protein multi alignments

### Sunday, Dec 10th

Started working on the project. Installed all necessary packages and read up on the project I have chosen.

Started by trying to write a script to check for and remove noise and then generate trees in the file `compute_trees`. Ran into some problems with the programs `fastprot` and `fnj`.

Also set up a start to a project report with all the appropriate sections.

Hope to be done by friday!

Tried to work out what I was doing wrong with `fastprot` and `fnj`, but I have been unable to locate the problem.

Started on the script to compare the trees in the file `tree_distance` instead. Using Dendropy proved very useful. However, I cannot try it out before I sort out my problems with generating the trees...

Also started writing a bit on the Introduction-part of my project report.
